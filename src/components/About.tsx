                Hi! I’m Teofilus Robert — a passionate and creative problem-solver with a love for building things that make life easier, more beautiful, or just more fun. With a background in frontend development and a curiosity that drives me to always learn more, I use modern tools and thoughtful design to bring ideas to life on the web. Whether I’m coding a sleek interface, crafting user experiences, or exploring something entirely new, I’m always focused on doing meaningful work that connects.
                <br/>Thanks for stopping by — feel free to explore, connect, or just say hello!</p>
